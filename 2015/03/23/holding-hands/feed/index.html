		<description><![CDATA[I think it is totally normal to feel fearful as your new baby approaches.  I have felt that during each of my last three babies.  Our rainbow baby was born with several lifelong issues and although he is doing well I think that compounded my fears similar to your tough pregnancy is for you.  I found the biggest sigh of relief was when our babies reached the point where they were older than their sister was and then again when they reached 1.  Birthdays mean a lot more after a loss.  I will keep thinking and praying for you on your journey.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for sharing. I too have leaned on God since my daughter died of SIDS. However recently I have become so fearful of the future and even praying hasn&#039;t brought me comfort. How did you get through the fears of a rainbow baby? I prayed for an easy pregnancy and God has given me anything but that. I&#039;m so scared about even getting my rainbow here, and also scared of SIDS again. I&#039;m on strict bed rest and my mind has had too much idle time to think, and fear.]]></description>
