				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday was the day!!</p>
<p>Haleigh is officially older than her sister was on earth.  It is the last time we will reach this first milestone.  We are so thankful to all those who prayed for our comfort during the past week.  Look at the smile we captured on our special day!!!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/06/1001464_10152031770162519_947957377_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-293" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/06/1001464_10152031770162519_947957377_n-168x300.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/06/1001464_10152031770162519_947957377_n-168x300.jpg 168w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/06/1001464_10152031770162519_947957377_n.jpg 539w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" /></a></p>
<p>We spent the day at family bible camp in Okoboji (<a href="http://www.okoboji.org/">http://www.okoboji.org/</a>).  We both agreed that while it was hard to leave Haleigh in the care of others it was equally hard hearing how much Haleigh looked like a doll with her beautiful skin and pretty smile.  That was a comment often said as people passed Clara&#8217;s body at the wake and funeral and rightfully so, she did look just like a doll in the casket.  So we both decided that was probably the hardest thing we experienced this time around.  The other thing that ranked up there in the &#8220;hard to deal with&#8221; category was the music.  Of course this year&#8217;s theme was &#8220;Remedy&#8221; and honestly perfect for us, but some of the music played was heart wrenching to hear since it was also played at Clara&#8217;s funeral which made it a bit more difficult for us.  That said, we had a wonderful time.  We met some amazing friends and the kids were never short of attention!!  The community really loves all and we were blessed to have a week away from home during our stressful time.  This week really helped us to focus on what really matters and less on our fears.</p>
<p>We are excited to have been given the opportunity to raise Miss Haleigh and are looking forward to our next &#8220;age&#8221; milestone of 4 months.  That day will be here very shortly.</p>
