				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like to do nice things for my husband. Â This yearÂ I wanted to try something new. Â After leaving behind my cake business I found a lot of spare time on my hands. Â I took to my favorite place&#8230; Pinterest to find something fun to do. Â I found a cute &#8220;12 Days of Christmas&#8221; idea. Â Here is a link to the page :<a href="http://www.passionatehomemaking.com/2011/12/on-the-first-day-of-christmas-my-true-love-gave-to-me.html">http://www.passionatehomemaking.com/2011/12/on-the-first-day-of-christmas-my-true-love-gave-to-me.html</a></p>
<p>I jumped on board and started planning. Â It was a lot harder than I expected. Â I was trying to stay in a small budget and still be creative and fun. Â Originally my first gift to my true love was going to be a shadow box for our family ticket stubs from movies, games, and other events but on impulse I gave that to him for his early December birthday.</p>
<p>As December days passed I started to worry I wasn&#8217;t going to find enough things to fill up the calendar. Â AÂ few days before I started leaving gifts, he was raving about the Christmas blend of Starbucks coffee he had enjoyed. Â Finally an idea I could use!</p>
<h2>Day 1: Â On the 1st day of Christmas his true love gave to him&#8230; A Bag of Coffee to brew.</h2>
<p>So there you have it!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/day-1-of-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-974" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/day-1-of-12-300x250.jpg" alt="day 1 of 12" width="300" height="250" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/day-1-of-12-300x250.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/day-1-of-12.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/day-1-of-12-624x520.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes I found it necessary to make each day rhyme. Â That, and him sitting on the couch while I was working them out, made things interesting for sure! Â He was quite surprised on the first day. Â Actually I wasn&#8217;t sure if he liked the idea or not.</p>
<h3>Day 2: Two Tasty Treats</h3>
<p>Day two was supposed to be our son&#8217;s surgery day so I opted for something I could share with him at the hospital. Â Of course the little man&#8217;s surgery got rescheduled so instead my husband got his Throwback Mt Dew and Reese&#8217;s Fastbreak at home. Â The funny thing is I had purchased a bottle of pop a couple days earlier and then accidentally left it on the counter and he drank it. Â When I saw him walk into the living room with it took all I had not to shake me head. Â I had to make an emergency trip to the Casey&#8217;s to get another one. Â It made for a fun and memorable day 2.</p>
<p>Sadly, I didn&#8217;t get pictures of each day. Â Some were more personal than others, some less. Â I did take pictures of a few of his favorites.</p>
<h2>Day 3: Three Naughty Pics</h2>
<p>By day 3 he was asking if there was a gift since I didn&#8217;t leave this one on the counter like the others. Â Boudoir photos in an envelope on the seat of his car. Â That was a winner. Â Yeah and Â sorry no pictures to share on this one <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>Day 4: Â Four Date Night Things</h2>
<p>This was supposed to be day 5 or 6 but plans were to go out of town and I didn&#8217;t think I wanted to drag along a couple wine glasses, a bottle of wine, and some massage oil. Â Lol&#8230; It just didn&#8217;t feel right. Â So it became day four. Rather than purchase a new bottle of wine I chose toÂ use one of the 3 bottlesÂ of the wine I still have from my bridal shower. Â  Six and a half years was not so friendly on the bottle we tried to drink. Â It was ok but nothing great. Â We probably should have drank it long ago but 4 kids in 5 years hasn&#8217;t allowed much time for enjoying a glass here and there.</p>
<h2>Day 5: Five Ornaments</h2>
<p>We have five kids in our arms so I thought it would be fun to enlist the help of the kids on this one. Â Each of them painted their hands white and helped me create snowmen out of their handprints. Â The turned out cute. *Another Pinterest idea* Â My husbandÂ actually got to watch us create these over Thanksgiving while we were making other family gifts.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-5-of-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-981" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-5-of-12-300x199.jpg" alt="Day 5 of 12" width="300" height="199" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-5-of-12-300x199.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-5-of-12.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-5-of-12-624x413.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h2>Day 6: Six Beers for Drinking</h2>
<p>There is nothing more weird than walking into a liquor store at 11 in the morning to purchase booze with three kids under the age of 5 in tow. Â The guy at the counter snickered while we were digging in the cooler creating our mixed 6pk. Â Or it could have been when my 5yo desperately wanted to carry the 6 glass bottles to the counter 2 at a time. Either way, we did a good job of picking a few favorites and a couple ones he had talked about trying.</p>
<h2>Day 7: Seven Ways I Love You</h2>
<p>The higher the day number the harder, and more creative, I had to be. Â So for day 7 I opted for different candies. Â I will admit I am creative however I am not good at creating many things completely from scratch. Â I really wanted to attach little tags. Â I had to google a while to find exactly what I was looking for but I finally locatedÂ something I liked. Â This sight is where I got the generic tags. Â <a title="Dating Diva's" href="http://www.thedatingdivas.com/you-me/show-him-the-love/clever-candy-sayings-for-almost-every-occasion/">http://www.thedatingdivas.com/you-me/show-him-the-love/clever-candy-sayings-for-almost-every-occasion/</a>Â I wasn&#8217;t completely satisfied with just the tags to I included some special moments that we have shared together that make me love him more.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-7-of-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-978" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-7-of-12-300x199.jpg" alt="Day 7 of 12" width="300" height="199" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-7-of-12-300x199.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-7-of-12.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-7-of-12-624x413.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h2>Day 8: Eight Blocks for Building</h2>
<p>The kids and I sifted through 2 totes of pictures to find enough to fill some cut up 2&#215;4&#8217;s and 2&#215;2&#8217;s. Â We painted the 8 blocks and used mod podge to attach the pictures. Â One side was pictures from our wedding and the other was our superheros. Â I attached our special Dad quote to the main block. Â I think the kids like them since they have already run off with them!</p>
<h2>Day 9: Nine Years of Christmas</h2>
<p>When I started this project I knew this day right away. Â This year we celebrated our 9th holiday season. Â While we were sifting through all our pictures I also located memories of our first two Christmas seasons as well as a picture card we have sent each year for the last seven. Â When I gave this gift my husband&#8217;s exact words were, &#8220;I thought you didn&#8217;t like scrapbooking.&#8221;. Â He is right, it really isn&#8217;t my thing but I will do something once if it might mean something to him. Â I left a place for writing our memories later. Â I thought that might be a fun way to spend a few date nights.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-9-of-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-977" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-9-of-12-300x199.jpg" alt="Day 9 of 12" width="300" height="199" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-9-of-12-300x199.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-9-of-12.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-9-of-12-624x413.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h2>Day 10: Ten Quotes Inspiring</h2>
<p>I thought this day was going to be easy. Â I was definitely wrong. Â I couldn&#8217;t decide if I wanted bible verses or quotes. Â There are good bible verses but I couldn&#8217;t quite find ones that fit the bill. Â I googled and found lots of quotes too. Â Again nothing quite was what I was looking for. Â Instead I used some of the quotes that were close to what I needed and added/changed some words to make them more personal. Â After the work I put into coming up with the quotes, I had no time to make them pretty. Â Just some construction paper and scrapbook stickers. Â I think he liked them just the same.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-10-of-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-973" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-10-of-12-300x246.jpg" alt="Day 10 of 12" width="300" height="246" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-10-of-12-300x246.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-10-of-12.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-10-of-12-624x511.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h2>Day 11: Eleven Favorite Cookies</h2>
<p>This was supposed to be his very favorite homemade chocolate chip cookies but if you had seen my counter you would understand why he got a bag of oreo cookies and a rain check. Â Christmas baking season and a holiday party filled the counter and 3 tupperware containers full of yummy treats. Â I think I can fit his special treat in January when he can enjoy them.</p>
<h2>Day 12: Twelve Date Nights Prepped</h2>
<p>So my husband is not a date night planner and likely never will. Â I decided to take day 12 to prepare a date night each month. Â Since day 12 landed on Christmas, he got to open a small box to find 12 envelopes. Each envelope hasÂ cash to use during our date and a certificate and cash to pay our two older boys for their daycare services. Â Each envelope has a date it must be used on. Â I chose the 12th of each month, fitting I suppose. Â According the to calendar it will only fall on a busy Friday or Saturday night once. Â All the other 12th&#8217;s are on week days. Â Now all we have to do is take turns deciding where to go or what to do. Â I can&#8217;t wait until Jan 12!!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-12-of-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-975" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-12-of-12-300x199.jpg" alt="Day 12 of 12" width="300" height="199" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-12-of-12-300x199.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-12-of-12.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/12/Day-12-of-12-624x413.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>My husband and I enjoyed this project enough I might try it again next year! Â I was able to keep days 1-11 within my $50 budget by using things around the house and purchasing a few things as needed. Â Now that I have a whole year to plan who knows what things I could find to do. Â The hardest thing will be keeping it under budget. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
