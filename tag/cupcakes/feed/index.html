				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mother&#8217;s Day turned out to be a wonderful day even though it was shared with the memories of such a terrible day. Â When I opened my bedroom door, I found a small pile of gifts from my older boys. Â Very cute!! Â They didn&#8217;t get them put on my dresser before I woke up so they left them outside my door and hoped the little boys didn&#8217;t destroy them.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_018.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-274" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_018-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_018-300x168.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_018-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>We started off the morning by going to church. Â Lincoln made it all the way through church sitting with us rather than going to nursery and Preston even fell asleep playing with a toy while in the nursery. Â Mason was complaining of the chills but had no fever so I chalked it up to him not wanting to sit through church. Â I couldn&#8217;t have been more wrong. Â Shortly after church was done Mason bolted for the bathroom. Â Unfortunately there was someone in the restroom so he had to vomit all over the hallway floor. Â My second Mother&#8217;s Day gift&#8230;not having to clean up after him. Â Thank you to our church janitor who so kindly cleaned it up for us while I watched and helped as Mason continue his struggle in the toilet.</p>
<p>After church we went to visit Clara at the cemetery. Â It has been far too long since we visited. Â We left her some pink and yellow flowers, Pink Lemonade <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Â I took a few pictures of our time there. Â The boys enjoyed visiting and of course climbing all over the flower bed. Â Haleigh was all smiles too.</p>

<p>After the cemetery we stopped for a quick breakfast. Â Chris ran in to the grocery store to pick up donuts and hot chocolate. Â While he was there I saw Elaine and gave her a big hug. Â We shared a tear and a quick chat. Â We then went home. Â At home I got to use my lovely gift from my little boys&#8230;Potholders. Â Perfect for the cake baking mom! Â I started baking cupcakes and a Â cake that was ordered.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_009.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-269" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_009-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_009-300x168.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_009-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>While the babies were napping and my cakes weere baking, I decided to head out and work on planting my garden. Â Tomatoes, spinach, peppers, beans, corn, onions, squash, carrots, and pumpkins made their way into the ground. Â I can&#8217;t wait to see the garden in a few weeks.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-270" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_011-168x300.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_011-168x300.jpg 168w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_011-576x1024.jpg 576w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_011.jpg 918w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" /></a></p>
<p>My garden planting and cake baking finished up about the same time so I decided to work on flowers for a few special people. Â I used the same pink and yellow daisies we left for Clara earlier in the morning. Â I added a beautiful little angel to each arrangement. Â I love!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_013.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-271" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_013-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_013-300x168.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_013-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>We had my mom out for supper. Â It was great to share the evening with her. Â I frosted up the cupcakes and added a strawberry to each. Â So delicious!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_015.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-272" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_015-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_015-300x168.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_015-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Supper was delicious but was quickly met with a little boy, vomit, and the carpet. Â He tried so hard but didn&#8217;t make it. Â So I got to use my little green machine for the first time of the night&#8230;. there were a few more times to follow <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_016.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-273" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_016-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_016-300x168.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_016-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>After the kids went to bed I decided to show Miss Haliegh some of my baking secrets.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_024.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-275" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_024-168x300.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_024-168x300.jpg 168w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_024-576x1024.jpg 576w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130512_024.jpg 918w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" /></a></p>
<p>I figure she can&#8217;t share them yet and she was more than happy to watch. Â We made the final graduation cake on my calendar before my gall bladder surgery. Â I think we did a pretty good job!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130513_003.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-276" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130513_003-300x204.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="204" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130513_003-300x204.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2013/05/WP_20130513_003-1024x698.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>All in all sharing Mother&#8217;s Day went very well. Â I spent much of the day busy which is my way of coping and works well. Â It helps me continue to make beautiful memories out of days that easily could be filled with sad ones. Â I am thankful that I got to share the day with my kids and husband. Â They make each day so special!</p>
