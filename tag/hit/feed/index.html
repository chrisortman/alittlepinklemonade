				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our tradition each year is to purchase an ornament for each of our kids. Â The hope is that when they leave they will have 18 ornaments to take with them for their first tree. Â The best part is finding that perfect ornament for them each year. Â It can be tricky to find the one that fits their current likes. Â Many times we visit the Hallmark store or <a href="http://www.personalcreations.com">PersonalCreations.com</a> to find/create the perfect one. Â This year neither of those places had what I was looking for. Â Even Etsy didn&#8217;t have something for each of my five kiddos.</p>
<p>I had seen a really cute TMNT ornament on Pinterest that I had wanted to try but at the time my kids weren&#8217;t really into them. Â That was until we moved to Iowa and lost the Disney Channel. Â Now Turtles are their favorite show, even my little lady&#8217;s. Â Since we now live near a few craft stores I can easily visit them when they have sales. Â So&#8230; I made 4 Ninja Turtles and 1 girl turtle. Â Did you know there was actually a girl turtle? Â I didn&#8217;t. Â Guess in some threads online there was a girl turtle by the name of Venus. Â If I had done my research I would have had 2 blues turtles instead of 2 purple. Oh well, Haleigh&#8217;s favorite character is still Minnie Mouse and her favorite color is purple. Â So that is what she got.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/01/Turtle-Ornaments.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-990" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/01/Turtle-Ornaments-300x199.jpg" alt="Turtle Ornaments" width="300" height="199" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/01/Turtle-Ornaments-300x199.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/01/Turtle-Ornaments.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/01/Turtle-Ornaments-624x413.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>I think they turned out pretty cute! Â They were super easy to make. It took me less than 20 minutes to create all 5. Â I didn&#8217;t go into a ton of detail. Â I know I could have made their mouths a bit different to create more aggressive turtles but that would mean I would have had to paint them all. Â I opted for a little makers and ribbon instead.</p>
<p>My only dilemma was on how to package these individually so each kid could unwrap their own. Â I certainly could leave them in the 6pk but there is no way 5 kids would open that gift without some elbows flying and frustration for us. Â While I was out looking for cake stuff I noticed the individual cupcake boxes and thought they might work.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/01/Turtle-Ornaments-packaged.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-991" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/01/Turtle-Ornaments-packaged-275x300.jpg" alt="Turtle Ornaments packaged" width="275" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/01/Turtle-Ornaments-packaged-275x300.jpg 275w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/01/Turtle-Ornaments-packaged.jpg 937w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/01/Turtle-Ornaments-packaged-624x682.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px" /></a></p>
<p>They worked great! Â So we had five little packages ready for five young ones to open Christmas morning. Â They loved them.
