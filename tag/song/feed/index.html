<p>Since the first day I saw the list of topics for this year&#8217;s #CaptureYourGrief project I have been thinking about today&#8217;s topic. Â In the past I have shared links to music that have touched me or mean something to me. Â I have to wonder what they mean to others because like books, music can speak differently to each of us. Â The beauty of music is that it catches every emotion we feel. Â I truly believe that the music we listen to is a reflection of everything we have been through.</p>
<p>The same is true for the songs from shortly after Clara&#8217;s funeral. Â Songs touched my heart and tore my heart out still have that affect sometimes. Â On other occasions they bring me comfort. Â It really depends on the day. Â Without a doubtÂ my song preferences have changed as my grief has changed. Â Songs mean different things at different times. Â They lose or gain meaning depending on our circumstances.</p>
<p>TwoÂ years ago I created a video in memory. Â Today that song still shares the thoughts that I often have. Â &#8220;Who would you be?&#8221; and &#8220;Who would you look like?&#8221; are things I have posted a lot about this month. Â Here is a link to that video<a href="https://youtu.be/WzarXf5z9Ms">Â https://youtu.be/WzarXf5z9Ms</a>. It is a song that I don&#8217;t hear often but when I do I immediately think of Clara and the future we missed.</p>
<p>As I was preparing for today&#8217;s topic I pulled out my accordion to play. Â I was so lost on where to go, what song to choose. I thought if a I just played a little music to get it might help me to get to into the right frame of mind. Â I had no idea the sheet music I was playing from would be my song and my words from the heart this year.</p>
<p>My grandpa gave me the song almost 9 years ago when he began teaching me to play. Â I have never really read the lyrics though. Â I mean I noticed the blue eyes crying and thought it was special considering I have blue eyes and missed so much of my life with him.</p>
<p>Grandpa always wanted me to play it upbeat but for some reason I just felt like this should be a soft, melancholy tune. Â I am sure my grandpa&#8217;s take on it is because for the most part artists like Â Willie Nelson play it a little faster. It is a love song I suppose. This one is my sad love song.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In the twilight glow I see her<br />
Blue eyes crying in the rain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">As we kissed good-bye and parted<br />
I new we&#8217;d never meet again</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Love is like a dying ember<br />
Only memories remain<br />
Through the ages I&#8217;ll remember<br />
Blue eyes crying in the rain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Now my hair has turned to silver<br />
All my life I&#8217;ve loved in vain<br />
I can see her star in heaven<br />
Blue eyes crying in the rain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Someday when we meet up yonder<br />
We&#8217;ll stroll hand in hand again<br />
In a land that knows no parting<br />
Blue eyes crying in the rain.</p>
<p>It certainly has Clara written all over it. Â SheÂ and I are both blue eyed. Â The day of the funeral I stood a long time next to her casket. Finally they told me they had to put the lid on and that when they did it would seal forever. Â There was no going back. Â I remember knowing I would never lay eyes on her again.</p>
<p>My love for her is truly in memories now. Â Some of those memories are old, some are made after her passing. Â One thing is certain is that as I get older, those memories are very precious to me. Â They will be all I have to remember her by. Â I know someday, when I am old and pass, I will hold her again.</p>
<p>Blue eyes crying in the rain&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<p style="text-align: center">Last year when I did this project I had several songs that reminded me of Clara and they still do. Â This year I wanted to do something different. Â I actually just heard this song last week and absolutely fell in love with it. Â I searched for a perfect video of it but couldn&#8217;t find the one that &#8220;hit home&#8221;. Â Creating a video in memory of Clara has been on my &#8220;to-do&#8221; list for 4 years. Â It has just never worked out when I have tried before whether it was computer issues or lack of abilities <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">I shed many tears creating this but it was so worth it. Â I am in love and the boys really like it too. Â  Â  &#8220;Gone Too Soon&#8221; really is where I am in my journey. Â I often times wonder what she would look like or what she would be doing today. Â I am even more curious about her the older Haleigh gets and the more people comment about how much she and Clara look alike. Â It is something to comes to mind when we visit friends who had little girls at the same time we had Clara. Â It is bittersweet to watch them grow. Â  We certainly still love her so much and not a day goes by that I don&#8217;t think about her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&#8220;See You Again&#8221; by Carrie Underwood was my second choice for today&#8217;s reflection. Â It really does bring comfort because I know I will see her again when I am called Home. Â Sometimes reminding myself of that promise is all I need to bring a smile back and help me to continue on. Â Every day is one day closer until we meet again!!</p>
