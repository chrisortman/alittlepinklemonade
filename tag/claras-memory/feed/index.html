<p style="text-align: center">We have always given to a child on the local Salvation Army Angel Tree.  After Clara passed we decided that each year we will find a child that is the same age Clara would be and go shopping.  For us it is healing to be able to walk through those girl aisles and look.  We get to purchase things we can imagine ourselves buying for her and give a gift to another child.  This year Chris and I did a date night and went shopping for our little girl.  &#8220;Taylor&#8221; was 5 and although Clara would have been 4 1/2 it was close enough for us.  We decided that we wanted to do clothes this year instead of toys.  We never really got a chance to buy any clothes for Clara.  Everything she wore before her death were gifts.  All the clothes we had purchased were still neatly on the hangers and although Haleigh did use some of them (and we donated a lot to the local shelter and teddy bear treasures program), it just isn&#8217;t the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">It didn&#8217;t take us long to fall head over heals for a pretty dressy outfit.  We quickly realized that $25 isn&#8217;t much for clothes so we started searching for sales online.  Thanks to Black Friday (or Gray Thursday) we found a great sale at Children&#8217;s place.  I couldn&#8217;t help but get the &#8220;keep on smiling&#8221; shirt!!  The smile it brings to our hearts and faces to be able to give to another child in need is something we look forward to each Christmas.  We hope that &#8220;Taylor&#8217;s&#8221; smile is as big as ours this Christmas.</p>
