				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Do you ever wonder what restaurants are thinking when they send out heaps of french fries on your plate?</h3>
<p>It seems like such a waste to me. Â Last week we took the kids out to eat and this is exactly what happened. Â Each plate was full of enough fries to feed us all&#8230;and we had 6 plates!! Â Against my husband wishes I kindly asked for a box to bring them home in. Â Hubby asked what I planned to do with them and I shrugged my shoulders. Â I figured I would think about it later.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2012/11/WP_0007821.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-186" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2012/11/WP_0007821-290x290.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="290" /></a></p>
<p>I made good on my promise that I would use them. Â It took a bit of looking.</p>
<h3>Tater Tot Casserole!</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2012/11/WP_000785.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-185" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2012/11/WP_000785-290x290.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="290" /></a></p>
<p>My husband was a bit skeptical as to how well it would cook up. Â I can honestly say I wasn&#8217;t sure how well it would cook since usually I use frozen tots. Â I layered all the ingredients and set the crock pot to low for about 2.5 hours.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2012/11/WP_0007861.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-187" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2012/11/WP_0007861-290x290.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="290" /></a></p>
<p>It was perfect! Â Preston seemed to like that it was french fries and the potatoes didn&#8217;t fall apart like tots. Â I did add more cheese than the recipe called for and I am glad I did. Â It kept the fries from getting too crunchy. Â  You will find the recipe I used below <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Â Enjoy!</p>
<h3>~French Fry Tater Tot Casserole~</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brown 2 lbs hamb with onion, Worcester sauce, and pepper</li>
<li>While my hamburger was browning I made my Cream of Chicken soup. Â Normally one would use Cream of Mushroom but my kids won&#8217;t eat it. Â Either way you can use canned if you prefer. Â Because of soy, I made my own C of Chix.</li>
<ul>
<li>2T butter melted in pan.</li>
<li>I added 1/3cup flour mix until flour is moist.</li>
<li>I then added 1 cup whole milk and 3 cups water. Â Whisk well to make sure all the flour/butter clumps are gone.</li>
<li>Then I added 4tsp chicken broth powder (use what is recommended on your label) and stirred well.</li>
<li>I simmered until it thickened.</li>
</ul>
<li>Combine hamburgerÂ with half the soup and put in bottom of crock pot</li>
<li>Add two cans drained french cut green beans on top of hamb</li>
<li>If you are using my Cream of Chicken simply place half of what is left over the green bean layer. Â If you are using store bought kind&#8230;Thin second can of cream soup with some water and pour about half over the green bean layer</li>
<li>Top with french fries</li>
<li>Pour remaining cream soup over top of fries</li>
<li>Sprinkle 2-3 cups shredded cheddar cheese over top (I used colby and mozzarella because that is all I had in the freezer. Â It tasted great.)</li>
<li>Cover and cook on low for 2.5 hours (donâ€™t overcook)</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Betty Crocker has a great recipe out there but with all of Lincoln&#8217;s allergies it was not an option to use. Â After a few attempts I revised her recipe into a fluffy, cake like creation that flew off the cooling rack faster than I could cool them. Â Every single mini muffin was gone within 24 hours of making them. Â I call that a hit!!!</p>
<p>I call this recipe soy free because my son tolerates vegetable oil without troubles. Â If you have troubles with soy oils you will want to use another option rather than vegetable oil spread.</p>
<div>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<dl>
<dt>1 1/4Â cups sugar</dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>1/2Â cup Country Crock spreadÂ </dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2 tsp baking powder</dt>
<dt></dt>
<dt>3 TBS Canola oil</dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>1 1/2Â cups mashed very ripe bananas (3 to 4 medium)</dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>1/2Â cup buttermilk ( I use whole milk with a dash of lemon juice)</dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>1Â teaspoon vanilla</dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2 1/2Â cups all-purpose flour</dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>1Â teaspoon baking soda</dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>1Â teaspoon salt</dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>1/2Â cup mini chocolate chips, if desired</dt>
</dl>
<div>
<h2 id="main_0_leftcolumn_0_ffrspot2_1_divBody">Directions:</h2>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Move oven rack to low position so that tops of pans will be in center of oven. Heat oven to 350Â°F. Grease muffin pans, either 2 &#8211; 12 cup muffin pans or 2 &#8211; 24 cup mini muffin pans. Â I prefer the mini muffin pans.</li>
<li>Mix sugar and butter in large bowl. Stir in baking powder and canola oil until well blended. Add bananas, buttermilk and vanilla. Beat until smooth. Stir in flour, baking soda and salt just until moistened. Stir in mini chocolate chips. Â Using a cookie scoop for mini muffins or ice cream scoop for regular muffins, place 1 scoop per muffin cup.</li>
<li>Bake mini muffins for 7-10 mins and regular muffins for 12-14 mins or until muffin tops begin to slightly brown. Â Wrap tightly and store at room temperature up to 4 days, or refrigerate up to 10 days.</li>
</ol>
<div>SERVINGS: 24 muffins or 48 mini muffins</div>
</div>
<h2>TIPS:</h2>
<p>I did also try this recipe with rice milk and a no milk buttery spread to make it lactose free. Â It will be a bit more dense if you do this but tasted great.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One child with allergies in a home with no other food allergies can make cooking tough. Â I have learned to modify many of our favorite recipes to make them acceptable to eat by all.</p>
<p>Meatloaf has always been a hit in our home. Â The problem is that the meatloaf recipe I used to use called for eggs and cheese. Â Of course our 2 year old is allergic to eggs and for a while had problems with cheese. Â My solution was to modify my old recipe into something he could eat. Â Below is the updated recipe we use that has been given 2 thumbs up by the entire family!</p>
<p>This recipe can also be used to make meatballs. Â I just prefer the easy, quicker method of meatloaf.</p>
<ul>
<li>1.5 lb &#8211; 93% lean hamburger</li>
<li>1/2 cup &#8211; instant white rice</li>
<li>1/2 small &#8211; onion, chopped</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>1 can &#8211; tomato soup</li>
<li>12oz &#8211; water</li>
<li>1-2 Tablespoons &#8211; WorcestershireÂ  sauce (be sure the brand is soy free)</li>
</ul>
<div>
<ol>
<li>In a medium bowl whisk together the tomato soup, water, andÂ WorcestershireÂ Â sauce. Â Set aside.</li>
<li>In a large bowl combine hamburger, rice, onion, half of the liquid bowl, and add a small amount of salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Spread hamburger mixture into a 13X9 pan leaving 1 inch between the meat and all sides of the pan. Â Now I prefer metal pans because the texture of the meat is better received by my babies. Â Glass dishes tend to leave the meatloaf a bit more crisp and I have more issues with the sauce boiling out of the pan.</li>
<li>Finally pour the remainder of the liquids bowl over the meatloaf and along the empty areas of the pan.</li>
<li>Bake covered for 45 mins or until center is 165*. Â  Removed the cover and bake for 5-10 more minutes to give the top a nice browned texture.</li>
</ol>
<div>Now that my son is allowed dairy, I have started adding cheese to the top of my meatloaf. Â I add 1 cup shredded mild cheddar to the top for the final 5-10 minute baking time.</div>
</div>
