<p>Having set up our diapering drawers for 3 in diapers has also created a fun place for my toddlers to play.  Unfortunately it also means a HUGE mess in my living room!  I could totally let this mess get to me and get super frustrated but instead I use it as a way to spend time with them and teach at the same time.</p>
<p>The little ones seem to really enjoy throwing the entire contents at each other and into the air like confetti.  I have decided that if it gives them great pleasure to do it, I won&#8217;t stop it.  Instead I use the cleanup as a great teaching tool that requires no cost.  Cleanup consists of a couple of different tasks.  Sometimes I simply have the boys picking up each diaper I ask for.  This teaches them to listen and respond to each request given by mom.  Other times we sort into piles and then put the diapers away.  This of course teaches sorting.  Lately I have been asking for patterns.  So they will bring me diaper A, then diaper B, and then diaper A again and so on.   We also stack in the drawers so that the diapers are facing same way which helps them with motor skills and recognition.</p>
<p>The boys enjoy sorting very much&#8230; I think too much right now but I know it will be short lived.  At some point they will grow tired of having to clean it up and will hopefully no longer empty the drawers.</p>
