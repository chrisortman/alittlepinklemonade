				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">Express Your Heart</h1>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/10/CaptureYourGriefDay14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1149" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/10/CaptureYourGriefDay14-200x300.jpg" alt="#CaptureYourGriefDay14" width="200" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/10/CaptureYourGriefDay14-200x300.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/10/CaptureYourGriefDay14.jpg 683w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/10/CaptureYourGriefDay14-624x936.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">After you lose a child there is a time where every post on Facebook and Twitter will drive you nuts.  They will make you angry, frustrated, and want to unfriend your childbearing aged friends.  They are the posts about daily frustrations, badly behaved kids, lack of sleep, achy bodies, heartburn hate, and any other tough situation parents sometimes go through as we raise children.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It is hard not to get caught up in these posts.  We want to share how lucky those parents are.  We want to tell them that we would trade anything to have another day like that.  Once in a while we do share our hurt feelings with the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">While these feelings are true to our hearts we have to remember to see it from the other side.  We HAVE to be careful not to hurt others in our own hurt.  As bereaved parents we ask others not to judge us, to allow us to share our thoughts as we walk our path.  In that same way we need to afford others the ability to share their thoughts without judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We all have frustrating days.  As you can see from the image I chose, it was an interesting February 2013 day for me.  I didn&#8217;t post this image on Facebook to make someone feel bad, sad, or inspire anger.  I simply wanted to say, &#8220;Here was my rough moment today.&#8221;  In no way does this mean that my moment was worse than the loss of a child.  It simply means that in my journey, in my day, this was my moment of wanting a do-over.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It is okay to vent our bad days once in a while.  It isn&#8217;t okay for us to judge each other.  We are all at different places in our lives.  I spent part of my afternoon asking a few mom&#8217;s, who haven&#8217;t lost an infant, about their online posts.  Not a single mom purposely aired frustrating days or &#8220;kids for sale, cheep.&#8221; posts to upset anyone.  They are simply saying&#8230; I need a do-over.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I spent several years getting angry over these types of posts.  I refrained from posting them myself.  Through time I have come to understand that those feelings are a part of my grieving process.  Today I look at them and giggle because I too have had those crazy days where I wonder, what I am doing.  Some of them are even a little bittersweet as I wonder how I would have handled them with little Clara.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">As we walk through our grief just remember that these posts are not meant to harm.  Parents really don&#8217;t want to sell their child.  They aren&#8217;t ungrateful for the gift of their children.  They simply are having a bad day.  A different bad day than you.  Please don&#8217;t be angry at their memory they shared today, be grateful that they are not walking the path of grief that we wouldn&#8217;t wish even on our worst enemy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today marks six years since I held Clara for the last time.  It also marks the first time that Clara&#8217;s entire life followed the same days of the week&#8230;like her birthday on a Wednesday, her passing being 2 days after Mother&#8217;s Day.  It is hard to imagine life without her and yet here we are living it.  Instead of having six years of memories I have three and a half months.  Sometimes the most vivid memories are not the &#8220;good&#8221; ones.  Each year as today approaches my thoughts are filled with memories of May 12, 2009 when I raced to the ER and held my breath for an hour while the doctors and nurses did everything they could to bring life back into her.  The afternoon where I held her earthly body for the last time.  The evening that I laid my baby&#8217;s body on the hospital gurney and walked away, leaving her behind in that empty room.  That night as we picked up the big boys from our daycare when we also left with an empty infant car seat and two boys asking where their sister was.  It is a day I wish I could forget and yet I don&#8217;t want to.  Each year I find the anticipation of this day is harder than the actual day itself.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/05/All5MothersDay2015.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1048" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/05/All5MothersDay2015-300x199.jpg" alt="All5MothersDay2015" width="300" height="199" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/05/All5MothersDay2015-300x199.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/05/All5MothersDay2015.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/05/All5MothersDay2015-624x413.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>As my family remembers year number six we do it in a place where Clara&#8217;s memorials are not close by.   A kind man listened to the story behind my blog and told me about a place in Iowa City that I might appreciate.  He was so right!  Along the river sits a statue of hope.  When we first got there I was sure of how I wanted to capture it through the lens of my camera, I knew what my hope was.  Instead I viewed something more heartwarming and thoughtful than I could have ever imagined.  The little ones were drawn toward holding the statue&#8217;s hands.  They kept taking and replacing the beads that were in her hands.  They took turns holding her hands like they were dancing.  I saw hope and love and a sense of calm.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/05/HopeHoldingHands2015.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-1050 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/05/HopeHoldingHands2015-199x300.jpg" alt="HopeHoldingHands2015" width="199" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/05/HopeHoldingHands2015-199x300.jpg 199w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/05/HopeHoldingHands2015.jpg 678w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2015/05/HopeHoldingHands2015-624x942.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" /></a></p>
<p>Every May 12th I reflect upon the future and I am filled with hope.  Hope that her life was not meaningless.  Hope that her loss has brought my husband, my children, and myself closer to God.  Hope that there is always a future even if it isn&#8217;t here on earth.  Hope that I am one day closer to seeing her again.</p>

<p>When I think about Miss Clara, can she feel it?  I like to think so, that is my hope.</p>
