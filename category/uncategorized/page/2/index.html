			<p>I am often taken aback when I hear people commenting on the loss of a child as though it was somehow the parents fault. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, there are times that it might actually be but I think for a majority of the time it isn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;When it comes to SIDS, I often hear it is a lack of parenting skills that led to the death of the baby. &nbsp;When is comes to suicide, I hear how the parents must not have been around enough or they didn&rsquo;t pay attention to their kids problems. &nbsp;When it comes to car accidents, the parents should have paid more attention or if the child was with someone else I hear that parents didn&rsquo;t do enough background checking on their child&rsquo;s friends parents. &nbsp;And even when my 4th child was born with birth defects, it was my fault because somehow I didn&rsquo;t take care of myself during the pregnancy. &nbsp;I just want to reach out and shake them!! &nbsp;Instead I try to remember that they likely haven&rsquo;t experienced the loss of a child nor cared for a special needs child.</p>
<p>As a parent who has lost a child I can tell you, I don&rsquo;t need to hear from outsiders that it was somehow my fault. &nbsp;I already have those thoughts in my head. &nbsp;Was it my fault, could I have prevented it? &nbsp;When I look at SIDS and the loss of my daughter I know there were things that could have reduced her risk of passing. &nbsp;Does that make me a bad parent for not knowing&hellip; I sure hope not. &nbsp;There is a sea of information out there and you can&rsquo;t possibly know everything. &nbsp;I did all the child prep classes, no one ever said a word about safe sleep and hardly 2 minutes was spent on &ldquo;back to sleep&rdquo;. &nbsp; The last thing I need to hear is that Clara died because of my poor parenting or even that it is God&rsquo;s way of weeding out the bad genes. &nbsp;These days I spend time getting the word out about SIDS in hopes to inform other parents so hopefully they will have many more days with their babies.</p>
<p>When it comes to Lincoln and his birth defects, I can&rsquo;t tell you how I mad was when I started hearing the stuff being said behind my back. &nbsp;We had genetic testing done and found his condition to be a random genetic mutation. &nbsp;No amount of prenatal care, folic acid, ect would have prevented it. &nbsp;Does that mean I am a bad mom?? &nbsp;I hope not. &nbsp;But even with these results I still hear that somehow I got what I prayed for or that God obviously is teaching me a lesson. &nbsp;For real?!?! &nbsp;We must not believe in the same God.</p>
<p>I simply ask for you to ask a parent the circumstances behind their child&rsquo;s passing or special need. &nbsp;Learn the facts directly from the mouth of the parent. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t rely on word of mouth or a quick internet search for all your info. &nbsp;Do any research after you know all the facts surrounding that child&rsquo;s life/passing. &nbsp; I am more than willing to tell you about Clara&rsquo;s passing or Lincoln&rsquo;s condition because it means that other parents learn new things, I can give you info to search on, and I am hopefully less judged.</p>
<p>When we know someone that has lost a child PLEASE to remember that most of the time it really was an accident that took their life. &nbsp;Something unpreventable by the parent and child, something out of their control. &nbsp;Instead of wasting time judging the parents on their parenting skills we should be offering support to all involved because you never know when something might take away your child or loved one and you might be in need of that same support you gave them.</p>

			<h3>One key way to ensure a successful budget:</h3>
<p>Recognize there is a difference between &ldquo;I need&rdquo; and &ldquo;I want&rdquo;. Stop, make a list of your needs and wants. Then go back and review your &ldquo;needs&rdquo;, are they really &ldquo;needs&rdquo; or just &ldquo;wants&rdquo; disguised as &ldquo;needs&rdquo; by our emotions?</p>
<h3>For example</h3>
<p>I need that new $20,000 car because mine broke down. &nbsp;No I want that $20,000 car and my broken down one is an excuse to overspend. &nbsp;Yes, I need a new car but one that fits in my budget not one that I fell in love with the minute I saw it &#128578; &nbsp;Taking out the emotion and recognizing what is a need and what is a want will help ensure successful budgeting.</p>

			<p>With guns being the hot topic these days, I thought I would add my opinion as a gun owner and a parent. &nbsp;Facebook probably isn&rsquo;t the best medium for it but it is nice to hear the feedback from friends and family on the issue. &nbsp;I think most of the time I get a well rounded set of opinions. &nbsp;That said I also got a few private messages from friends stating their opinions as well. &nbsp;Most of them I understand where they are coming from and respect them for it.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;I had one individual who was very upset with my view point and thus sent me a &ldquo;helpful&rdquo; message that stated&hellip;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You are crazy! &nbsp;I can guarantee you that the day the government or anyone else with a gun comes to your house and kills you and your family, I will be laughing. &nbsp;You are stupid to believe that killing should be the last resort. &nbsp;If you enter my home I will kill you, whether you have a gun or not. &nbsp;I will make sure to stop by your grave and laugh at how well your god protected you. &nbsp;God won&rsquo;t protect you and you are stupid if you believe that. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t protect your daughter, isn&rsquo;t she buried in the ground already? &nbsp;I will protect my family at all costs but if you support gun restrictions I promise you, I won&rsquo;t protect yours and neither will your god.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>To that I simply replied&hellip;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I am not asking you to protect my family. &nbsp;I was taught that killing someone is wrong and it is an absolute last resort. &nbsp;Hopefully I will never need a gun to protect my family. &nbsp;As for my God protecting me and my family. &nbsp;Yes He will. &nbsp;It may not be the way my mind would want Him to but He always does. &nbsp;God didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;save&rdquo; my child to live another day in this messed up world but He did save her from the depths of Hell and she is safe in His arms. &nbsp;That kind of protection is more than I could have asked for. &nbsp;He will do the same for me, my husband, my children, and all of His believers. &nbsp;That said, I am afraid I wouldn&rsquo;t want you and your guns protection. &nbsp;I will however lock my doors out of fear that people like you own guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And people wonder why there is so much fear&hellip;</p>

			<p>After seeing the video that is circulating friends pages on Facebook about Sandy Hook, I am greatly angered. I have spent time asking myself why it angers me so. First, I have to remind myself that this is someones ill attempt at trying to explain something they simply can&rsquo;t understand. The situation at Sandy Hook is so hard to comprehend. What makes someone do this? For many the gun talks that have come from this tragedy only can result in only one thing&hellip;.conspiracy. We have dealt with this before. After 9/11 there were many who couldn&rsquo;t believe something like that could happen and they did their best to come up with a &ldquo;rational&rdquo; way to understand. For some, humans will do whatever they can to find a way to explain, rationalize, and understand what has happened without concern for those they may hurt.</p>
<p>This brings me to the reason it hits home so much for me. After Clara passed, I spent many hours and days trying to find answers. &nbsp;SIDS or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome was not something I truly understood at the time. &nbsp;In my searching I found many websites, Facebook sites, and blogs that were nothing but peoples attempts to understand or explain SIDS. &nbsp;Many sites said SIDS was nothing more than a parents way of getting off with killing their babies. &nbsp;Another one I read was about how the government was experimenting on our children through vaccinations (which is why they track lot numbers) and see how many die. &nbsp;These types of sites are not helpful to any grieving parent nor do they provide the public with good information so they can support others when a child is lost. &nbsp;They simply create judgements of parents and families.</p>
<p>When we look into Sandy Hook &nbsp;&ndash; Just because those families &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t get to view&rdquo; their child doesn&rsquo;t mean their child didn&rsquo;t die. &nbsp;Just because the autopsy of each individual hasn&rsquo;t been released doesn&rsquo;t mean they didn&rsquo;t die&hellip;the physical body autopsy may be complete but often any blood tests or such can take weeks to come back. &nbsp;It took 45 days to get the full report for Clara. &nbsp;Just because there is no surveillance video released doesn&rsquo;t mean they are doctoring it, maybe it means they are giving these families privacy from having to watch the horror their children saw. &nbsp;Maybe they are trying to honor our wishes to stop sensationalizing these terrible tragedies in the media.</p>
<p>As for the craziness to the reporting and how things were always changing&hellip; Stop and think about how quickly the rumor mill in your town hits and how varied stories can be when there is a terrible accident or a suspicious death. &nbsp;I can tell you that some of the things I heard about how Clara died were so off the wall and yet mixed with some very correct info. &nbsp;It happens.</p>
<p>So before you share that video you should ask yourself&hellip;am I helping those families that lost their children or am I spreading rumors.</p>

			<p>For the past month many of you have been sharing what you are thankful for each day. &nbsp;I really have enjoyed seeing how each person is unique in their own way. &nbsp;For some, thankfulness is simple, for other much more complex. &nbsp; There is so many ways to be thankful. &nbsp;Thankful for family, friends, community, simple daily tasks, things going the way we had hoped, not being angry or frustrated. &nbsp;I think all of those are perfect reasons to be thankful. &nbsp;I am fortunate to be allowed to see and read each of your posts.</p>
<h3>I have found over the past 3 years a change in how I view thankful.</h3>
<p>After Clara died I wanted to remind everyone to not take for granted their kids, spouse, family, and friends. &nbsp;My innocence was lost, I know a child can die. &nbsp;I know the pain. &nbsp;It upset me when others complained about how their kids behaved or the stress they caused. &nbsp;I used to be angry and jealous because I would give anything for those sleepless nights, crying and whinny kids, and all the unpleasant things that happen in our day to day child raising years. &nbsp;Why can&rsquo;t people just be thankful for what they have? &nbsp;I failed to realize that they are thankful, even though the idea shared didn&rsquo;t appear that way.</p>
<h3>Today I realize we are all human.</h3>
<p>We need to be able to &ldquo;vent&rdquo;. &nbsp;Does that mean we aren&rsquo;t thankful??? &nbsp;Absolutely not! &nbsp;Should I be upset with someone who &ldquo;vents&rdquo;?? &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;I am thankful that is the worst they have to endure today. &nbsp;It can always be worse. &nbsp;I am thankful they might still have a bit of innocence in them. &nbsp;I am thankful that today they still have a story to share. &nbsp;I am thankful their kids are still with them. &nbsp;I am thankful they are here with us today. &nbsp;I might complain about my 3 hours of sleep, but maybe saying that helps me let the small stuff roll off my back so I can deal with something more stressful. &nbsp;You might complain about how badly you hate your job but that you are at least thankful to be working. &nbsp;Do I think that is wrong&hellip;nope, we are not going to love everything about our day but you are taking the time to find something positive in something that seems less than positive. &nbsp;You are &ldquo;turning that frown upside down&rdquo; as my boys would say it. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know what is going on in each of your lives and I honestly have no way, nor is it my job, to decide what is complaining too much or what is not thankful enough.</p>
<h3>Same goes for thankfulness sharing.</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to judge based on what I would be thankful for verses what you are thankful for. &nbsp;I might giggle at your thought but that is because I am happy that you take the time to share something with the rest of us. &nbsp;I am thankful I get to read something you have shared. &nbsp;There is no guarantee I will get to read your post tomorrow so &nbsp;I am thankful to get to learn more about you today. &nbsp;I think many of us forget that each of our lives is so different. &nbsp;No two people experience the same things throughout life. &nbsp;No two people will share the same thankfulness ideas. &nbsp;I won&rsquo;t share the same thankful ideas that a 20 year old will (my dating and partying days are long behind me) and I wouldn&rsquo;t expect to share the same as someone the same age or even older. &nbsp;I am unique and so are you. &nbsp;That is what makes what you share so interesting to read.</p>
<h3>So what should you be thankful for?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, only you do. &nbsp;Only you know how thankful you really are. &nbsp;Only you know why it is so important to share. &nbsp;I am just thankful to read about you another day &#128578;</p>

			<h3>Today I am thankful for not burning down the house.</h3>
<p>Somehow when I made supper the last night a &ldquo;simmer&rdquo; burner got left on. &nbsp;No one noticed it until I went to make lunch and I moved a pan to reveal a little blue flame. &nbsp;oops! &nbsp;I am very thankful nothing accidentally was placed on the stove.</p>
<h3>I am also thankful I got to treat the boys for setting and exceeding their October school goals.</h3>
<p>We are trying to teach Damon and Mason the importance of setting goals. &nbsp;Last month we sat down with them and together we came up with some goals to challenge them. &nbsp;I am pleased to report that both boy successfully met and exceeded them. &nbsp;This month we have set another few goals and this time they are a bit more challenging. They really enjoyed sharing ice cream with us and we are thankful to be able to share it with them.</p>

			<h2 style="text-align: center">It&rsquo;s November and Thanksgiving is right around the corner.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">After spending 31 days sharing my grief, I can&rsquo;t think of a better way to spend November but by sharing 30 things I am thankful for.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">~~~~</p>
<h2>Society teaches us to focus on all the negative and sadly I am often guilty as well.</h2>
<p>I remember after Clara passed away the one thing that got me through each day was to focus on something good that happened that day. &nbsp;Small things like something my boys said or that more loads of laundry were done than were left undone. &nbsp;I sometimes forget to do that now.</p>
<p>So I want you to all know, yes I am thankful for my God. &nbsp;Thankful for my friends and family. &nbsp;Thankful to have my kids and husband each day. &nbsp;That said, this month I want to focus on what happened on each particular day and why I am thankful for it. &nbsp;Sometimes my &ldquo;thankfulness&rdquo; may sound silly to you, but to me there is some reason I feel blessed. &nbsp;I will try to explain why it each was such a good thing &#128578;</p>
<p>Now to play catch-up from twitter and facebook&hellip;</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Day #1: &nbsp;30 Days of&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Thankfulness&amp;src=hash"><s>#</s><strong>Thankfulness</strong></a>: Nov 1 ~Encouraging MRI results for Lincoln, his quick wake-up from sedation, &amp; our safe trip to/from Sioux Falls.</h3>
<p>I will just leave a link to his caringbridge. &nbsp;I think that will explain why. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/lincolnortman/journal">http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/lincolnortman/journal</a>&nbsp; (Read Results are Early)</p>

<h3>Day #2: 30 Days of #Thankfulness: Nov 2 ~I am thankful for a little place called Shopko Optical where they will replace kids glasses, free of charge, for one year. They will even pull the only matching frame off their shelf and send you home with a them on the spot, even when it is twice in a single week! That is amazing customer service and leaves me one thankful mom.</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say Lincoln broke his glasses on Tuesday night and they sent us home with a brand new pair right off their shelf. &nbsp;Today he broke them again and when I called they offered to do the same. &nbsp;When I asked if there was anything I could do to help offset the cost, they said not to worry. &nbsp;This puts the total new pairs to 2, new glasses sides to 2, new nosepads to 6 all since July 2012!!! &nbsp;I am so thankful not to have to spend $70+ each time they break.</p>

			<h1>Day #28: &nbsp;Memories of Grief</h1>
<p>Today is a day devoted to sharing my memories of grief, the bad and the good. &nbsp;I often try to remind myself that each individual deals with grief in their own way. &nbsp;Some people are aware of others pain while some are so deeply into theirs they are unable to see those around them. &nbsp;Grief is always there even when I smile or say everything is okay. &nbsp;Grief is but a song, picture, or word away and tears are often fought back to hide it. &nbsp;I am a very private griever. &nbsp;Throughout my childhood I have been taught that it isn&rsquo;t okay to express how you feel especially when others don&rsquo;t feel or believe the same as you. &nbsp;I was taught that you reap what you sow&hellip;and during my daughters life and death, I was reminded several times that. &nbsp;Many times I felt as though this was somehow my fault. &nbsp;From 2 of our 4 sets of parents accusations that vaccinating my child caused this to the comments about allowing our children to resume daycare at the same location, I was left to feel very alone.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2012/10/Day-28-Memories-of-Grief.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-157" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2012/10/Day-28-Memories-of-Grief-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2012/10/Day-28-Memories-of-Grief-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2012/10/Day-28-Memories-of-Grief.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>Today I will begin with some of the bad memories that have profoundly impacted me. &nbsp;These things have left me with a silent grief that until now I have rarely shared with anyone. &nbsp;I hope being able to share them will allow me to heal from the wounds that, even today, feel so fresh and bring tears to my eyes as I write this.</p>
<p>I live life to be a giving person. &nbsp;I want others to be happy. &nbsp;When I found out I was pregnant I wanted family to be involved. &nbsp;Who doesn&rsquo;t right? &nbsp;We have family that were unable to conceive a child and when they asked for the opportunity to be there for the birth of Clara I said yes. &nbsp;Witnessing the birth of any child is such an amazing thing, the feelings that are there are not reproducible in any other way. &nbsp;I quickly realized that something was terribly wrong when Grandma stepped in to hold &ldquo;her baby&rdquo; before me&nbsp;(the exact words were &ldquo;Let me hold my baby&rdquo; as she tried to take Clara out of Daddy&rsquo;s arms minutes after she was born). &nbsp;As we were getting ready to move to our room, Grandma kindly offered to get some food since the hospital thought it would be about an hour before they could get some food located. &nbsp;I quickly said yes please since it had been 36 hours since my last meal. &nbsp;An hour and a half later they came back with a sandwich. &nbsp;When Chris asked what had taken so long she responded, &ldquo;We went to have a steak dinner to celebrate the birth of our baby Clara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clara&rsquo;s death didn&rsquo;t ease the growing tension. &nbsp;My grief seemed to take a backseat to hers. &nbsp;While sharing my last moments with Clara in the ER people started to hear the news and came to support us. &nbsp;I sat in a rocking chair holding my little girl for the last time and wishing that this was just a dream. &nbsp;While I sat there rocking Clara she came in, walked over, and took my baby out of my arms&hellip; without speaking a word. &nbsp;She walked over to her son, who was on the other side of the room, and hugged him and rocked Clara. &nbsp;I was in shock! &nbsp;After 15 minutes I actually had to ask for Clara back. We finally had to ask for privacy so that Chris and I could sit together and hold Clara one last time together, sing her favorite song, and kiss her goodbye.</p>
<p>The wake and funeral weren&rsquo;t much better. &nbsp;I was told what music wouldn&rsquo;t be played at &ldquo;her&rdquo; babies funeral, everytime someone hugged Chris or I she started bawling loudly as to get attention, and my own mother brought up how SIDS in Japan is so low because they don&rsquo;t immunize babies until they are over a year. &nbsp;I think the thing that affected me most, however, was the wake. &nbsp;We were not the ones standing/sitting by Clara&hellip;no we were halfway down the long line of hugs, thanking everyone for their support, crying, and watching as the same set of grandparents stood at Clara&rsquo;s casket hugging their friends and crying out how unfair it was that &ldquo;their baby&rdquo; was dead. &nbsp;It was at that point I realized my grief had taken a backseat to theirs. &nbsp;I should have listened to the friends and family who came over and asked it we wanted to have them talk to these grandparents and ask them to sit down or excuse themselves for a few minutes. &nbsp;At that point I was telling myself and others that everyone grieves differently. &nbsp;I had no idea how greatly that image would impact my own grief.</p>
<p>After the funeral there was the task of sorting and dividing out the beautiful flowers others had given in Clara&rsquo;s memory. &nbsp;This too was quite the production. &nbsp;Remember a few days ago I said how the flowers were a reminder of Clara and how hard it was to throw the dead ones away? &nbsp;Same goes for giving them away too. &nbsp;I will never forget the argument that ensued when someone didn&rsquo;t get the flowers that were sent for her in memory of &ldquo;her&rdquo; baby! &nbsp;I guess I assumed that these flowers were sent in memory of Clara and that since Chris and I were parents, we could choose the ones we kept and offer the rest to family and friends. &nbsp; I felt like someone had knocked my legs out from under me. &nbsp;Not only is my child dead but someone is more worried about what flowers were &ldquo;theirs&rdquo; rather than allowing the me to at least choose the ones I wanted to take home. &nbsp;Again my baby was someone else&rsquo;s, my grief took a backseat to someone elses.</p>
<h2>I can&rsquo;t even begin to describe how alone I felt&hellip;</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think I could feel anymore lost until I was told that &ldquo;Sometimes, when we get off God&rsquo;s path, He has to do something drastic to bring you back. &nbsp;You let someone else take over your life and raising your child. &nbsp;Now you suffer the consequences.&rdquo; &nbsp;In the next breath I was then told &ldquo;We think God didn&rsquo;t have anything for us to learn from Clara&rsquo;s life and passing. &nbsp;God did this so that your eyes would open and you could see the problems you created and now you have on your hands.&rdquo; &nbsp;NO ONE has the right to say something like this.</p>
<p>I am not sure if I will ever be far from the grief of losing Clara. &nbsp;I also don&rsquo;t know if how long it will take to heal from the wounds and grief I feel from those around me. &nbsp;I have grown to know that I can help others even when I am in such grief that I don&rsquo;t think, I myself, am going to make it. &nbsp;I know that helping others deal with grief helps me deal with my own. &nbsp;I also know that I have the most supportive husband in the world who will move mountains to help me not feel so sad, hurt, and discouraged. &nbsp;The whole journey has solidified my reliance on God and being able to freely have someone to listen even if I never hear a word back or see any changes. &nbsp;I thankful for and love those who shared the walk with us, even those who sometimes walked on their own sidewalk across the street from us. &#128521;</p>
<h2>Good memories of the grief journey are harder to come by&hellip;</h2>
<p>I have so many good memories of the time we had with Clara and I try to focus on those memories to block out the painful ones of her death. &nbsp;But there have been a few positive things that have happened during our journey after Clara&rsquo;s death. &nbsp;Damon and Mason are well adjusted boys who know just when to say the right things to make us proud. &nbsp;They share some of their stories of Clara or the funeral with us and we are blessed to have that. &nbsp;We also have a wonderful, loving daycare provider and family who have become family to us. &nbsp;Our relationship with them is one of trust, love, and understanding.</p>
<h2>After a parent loses a child they are left with such heavy, empty arms&hellip;and a lot of love to give.</h2>

<p>There are also 2 almost 3 new faces of hope from our journey. &nbsp;Their names are Lincoln, Preston, and our soon to be announced new baby. &nbsp;After Clara was born we knew we were done having kids. &nbsp;Chris and I had a complete family of 5. &nbsp;We were so in love and our boys were so happy. &nbsp;Shortly after Clara passed away we realized that we had so much love to give. &nbsp;Were we selfish to not offer it to more children? &nbsp;Were we trying to replace Clara? &nbsp;Is this normal to feel this way?? &nbsp;We talked about it several times before we knew that we were not increasing our family to replace her.</p>
<p>Almost 11 months after Clara passed away we were blessed with the birth of Lincoln. &nbsp;A boy! &nbsp;We were relieved and yet sad. &nbsp;For us the opposite gender is just what we needed. &nbsp;Lincoln has kept us busy and has taught us what it means to trust again. &nbsp;When he was just 5 months old he was diagnosed with &ldquo;PELVIS Syndrome&rdquo; and possibly would have lifelong medical issues. During that time we also found out Preston was on his way too. &nbsp;Preston was born just 26 months after Clara passed. &nbsp;Preston is so laid back and reminds us very much of Clara. &nbsp;We did say we had love to share right?!?! &nbsp;Well now we will add another face to the family March 2013. &nbsp;With each new baby comes a flood of emotions as each one smiles, walks, talks, or hits other milestones. &nbsp;I am sad for what I missed with Clara but fortunate to have the opportunity to see another child hit them.</p>

<p>We have again decided that our family will be as complete as it can be on earth. &nbsp;We are happy to be raising 4 soon to be 5 children and are ready to share our love with the 5 kids we hold hands with everyday.</p>
